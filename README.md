# Mortgage Loan Eligibility Prediction

## Project Description

This project develops a predictive model to assess mortgage loan applications, determining eligibility based on a variety of factors such as gender, marital status, education, income levels, and credit history. The model employs a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify applicants, helping financial institutions mitigate risks and make informed loan approval decisions.

## Motivation

The motivation behind this project was to simplify and enhance the decision-making process in loan approvals for financial institutions. By automating the eligibility assessment, the project aims to decrease default rates and provide a systematic approach to managing loan applications.

##Technologies Used
Python 3: The core programming language used for the project.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: For numerical operations on large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices.
Seaborn: For data visualization.
Scikit-Learn: For implementing machine learning algorithms.
##Features
Data Preprocessing: Includes cleaning, missing value imputation, and encoding categorical variables.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualize data to understand the distribution and relationship between variables.
Predictive Modeling: Uses SVM to predict loan eligibility.
Model Evaluation: Assesses the model's performance using accuracy metrics.
